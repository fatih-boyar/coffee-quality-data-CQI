## Sensory evaluations (coffee quality scores)
* *Aroma:* Refers to the scent or fragrance of the coffee. It is evaluated both when the coffee is dry and when it is wet after adding hot water.
* *Flavor:* The flavor of coffee is evaluated based on the taste, including any sweetness, bitterness, acidity, and other flavor notes.
* *Aftertaste:* Refers to the lingering taste that remains in the mouth after swallowing the coffee. It can be pleasant or unpleasant, and is evaluated for its duration and quality.
* *Acidity:* Acidity in coffee refers to the brightness or liveliness of the taste. It is often described as a tangy or sour sensation, and is an important aspect of the flavor profile of coffee.
* *Body:* The body of coffee refers to the thickness or viscosity of the coffee in the mouth. It can be light, medium, or full-bodied, and is evaluated for its texture and weight.
* *Balance:* Balance refers to how well the different flavor components of the coffee work together. A coffee that is well-balanced has a harmonious flavor profile, with no single flavor note dominating the others.
* *Uniformity:* Uniformity refers to the consistency of the coffee from cup to cup. When evaluating uniformity, tasters look for consistency in all aspects of the coffee, including aroma, flavor, and body.
* *Clean Cup:* A clean cup refers to a coffee that is free of any off-flavors or defects, such as sourness, mustiness, or staleness. A clean cup is desirable in high-quality coffee.
* *Sweetness:* Sweetness is an important aspect of the flavor profile of coffee, and is evaluated separately from the other flavor notes. It can be described as caramel-like, fruity, or floral, and is a desirable quality in coffee.
